About the optimization process
------------------------------

These models are decimated, retopologized and UV-unwrapped in [Houdini].
The Normal maps and the occlusion maps are generated with using [xNormal].
There is another repository ([ThreeDScansWorking]) that contains working
project files. See that repository for further details.
